# Harvard Referencing Tool
A simple tool that makes Harvard referencing 10 times easier. So now you have a simple choice to make:

- [ ] Take forever to complete references and possibly mess some of them up

OR

- [x] Use this app and save your time

## Installation
To install, simply download the GitHub repo, unzip and run "Harvard Referencing Tool.html" in a browser.

#### Reference Image (How to download)

The system has been tested in google chrome, but should have no foreseen issues in any other mainstream browser.

## Note To Programmers
I am aware there are better ways of structuring the code here into separate files etc. This would make the JavaScript much easier to manage and develop moving forward. The reason that it is all on the one page is because I wanted this to be something that everyone can just download and run without having to setup anything else extra.
